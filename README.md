## Gameplay
- **General**
  - **Low Health Threshold**
    - ~~At or below 25%~~ ⇒ Below 25% </br> *Developer Notes: Have fun using Blood Shrines a second time. Just...be careful.*
- **Survivors**
  - **Commando**
    - Double Tap
      - Slightly increased the duration of the second shot
    - Tactical Dive
      - No longer cancels sprinting for a frame on activation </br> *Developer Notes: Missing the sprint bonus caused dive to travel less distance than expected. It should be a much more viable option now.*
    - Suppressive Fire
      - Base Bullet Count: ~~6~~ ⇒ 8
      - Now has a much more prominent 'auto-aim' effect
    - Frag Grenade
      - Explosion Damage: ~~700%~~ ⇒ 900%
      - Blast Damage Falloff: ~~Sweetspot~~ ⇒ Linear
      - 1s detonation fuse begins immediately rather than after impact
      - Update explosion VFX and SFX </br> *Developer Notes: Both of Commando's special skills were frequently underwhelming. Suppressive Fire should feel more distinct from Double Tap now; Frag Grenades will be doing roughly the same damage but offer a better reward for perfect explosion placement.*
  - **Huntress**
    - Arrow Rain
      - Proc Coefficient Per Tick: ~~0.2~~ ⇒ 0.5
      - Slightly extended hitbox upwards to better match visuals
      - Update description to include accurate damage per second values
  - **Bandit**
    - Blast
      - Reduced spread bloom per shot
    - Serrated Dagger
      - Lunges Bandit forwards a short distance when swinging (as the description already indicated)
    - Serrated Shiv
      - Damage: ~~240%~~ ⇒ 140%
      - Base Stock: ~~1~~ ⇒ 2
      - Improve consistency of the projectile's trajectory against close targets
      - Update visuals to be more consistent between throws
    - Smoke Bomb
      - Cooldown: ~~6s~~ ⇒ 8s *Developer Notes: Because Smoke Bomb's cooldown ticks down even while the smoke is active, the skill had an incredibly short effective cooldown. A slight cooldown increase should result in more thoughtful Smoke Bomb use and give Lights Out a chance to shine.*
